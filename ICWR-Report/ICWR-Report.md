### Fuzzy-ID3 Algorithm for Breast Cancer Disease Classification

Breast cancer comes in second, among women with cancer.

The ENTROPYMOC algorithm achieved the highest accuracy outcome in the Coimbra dataset, with 74.138% accuracy in comparison between current works.

Although the ENTROPYMOC algorithm is more robust, it still preserves the identical properties of the standard ID3 algorithm. The restrictions of the proposed method, inclusive of inconstancy and overfitting troubles, can be overcome through implementing ensemble methods within the future.

the classification of breast cancer can be achieved using a variety of methods, including neural networks, â€¦
Used 3 dataset: WBCD (original), WDBC(Diagnostic), Coimbra.
improve 429 persion detection to 439.

Materials & Methods:
 * Image Blending Data Augmentation
   - Introducing a novel method for producing synthetic images
   - Convert to grayscale, and crop the source image
   - Paste the enhanced source image in the center of the target image

 * Data Collection
   - This dataset contains COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 images, with a high level of diversity and generalizability to cover patients from various geographical arcas.
   - Including variety of male and Female patients ranging in age from 8 to 89 years with varying degrees of pulmonary involvement.

 * Data Collection
   - COVID-19 submillimetric CT [6]
   - COVIDNet-CT [3]
   - HUST-19 [4]
   - iCTCE [4]
   - COVID-CT [5]

 * CNN Architectures with Transfer Learning
   - Ensemble models of AlexNet, ResNet5O, DenseNet201, VGG16 and InceptionV3

### A Machine Learning-based Approach for Medical Insurance Anomaly Detection by Predicting Indirect Outpatients' Claim Price

* Motivation -> 10% fraud claims with 28,860 Billion Toman values in 1397 (2018)
* Paid Amount (Numerical): -> the patient receive this price after various considerations
* Problem -> Finding Claims with Abnormal Paid Prices
* Hiypothesis -> Predicting Paid Price using Machine Learning Techniques and Finding Claims with Higher Errors

Related Works
 * Supervised classification methods, such as decision trees and neural networks 
   - used for fraud detection in healthcare
   - Decision trees show a better performance in fraud detection

 * The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm
   - used for fraud prediction, and data discretization
   - aggregation can help with anomaly detection

 * Interactive leaming ideas
   - used for anomaly detection
   - accuracy is limited without user feedback

 * Binomial Jabelling is the most commonly used method
   - most commonly used method for abnormal behavior detection 
   - it is time consuming and requires user feedback and restraining

 * Outlier prediction is another method for abnormal behavior detection
   - the metric used for other detection can become biased over time

### Farsi CAPTCHA Recognition Using Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network

 * The creation of efficient CAPTCHA-breaking algorithms in the context of Persian can help safeguard Farsi-speaking users from a variety of online dangers and enhance their overall online experience
 * Our approach to Farsi CAPTCHA is a combination of the TPS-Resnet-BiLSTM-ATIN
 * Our proposed model was tested, and it showed amazing accuracy of 96.625%


Dataset of 41000 images containing various font farsi words.
 * They added some noises too.
&nbsp;
 * They combined the TPS-Resnet-BiLSTM-ATIN model to provide revolutionary method. for cracking Persian captchas.
 * With a dataset of 41,000 samples, our suggested model was tested, and it showed amazing accuracy of 96.625%

### A novel Fuzzy Logic-based Method for Modeling and Recognizing Yoga Pose

 * It uses 2 approach
   - Top to Bottom 
   - Bottom to Top

The MediaPipe detects about 33 key points on the human body.

 * Result & Dataset 
   - They used the AR dataset, which contains a wide range of human gestures in nature and yoga/fitness poses.
   - Yoga was selected because it has some of the most complex and interesting examples of human positions.
